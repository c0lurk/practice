                <p>Hello, world!</p>
                <p>Welcome to my first web page!</p>
            
                <p>Here are some things I'm going to learn about coding:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>HTML</li>
                  <li>CSS</li>
                  <li>JavaScript</li>
                  <li>And a lot more!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Check out <a href="http://moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>. It's a great place to learn web development skills!</p>
        </p>
        
        <p>The goal for this lesson is to illustrate how simple HTML is to read and write by showing some text written in HTML and what it looks like when it is displayed in a web browser.</p>
